## Overview

Most data structures have at least 3 kinds of operations. `ADD` an item (build a structure), `REMOVE` an item (un-build a structure) and `FIND` an item (search a structure).

## List 

List operators: `new`, `ins`, `rem`, `get`, `find`, `size`, `empty`. A list starts with the first element in positio `0`. If we have a list size of `N`, then the position should be between `0` and `N-1`.

### List Behaviors

* Empty list have size 0.
* On `ins`, size of list increases by at most 1.
* On `ins`, the sequence of original elements remain the same.
* On `rem`, size of list decreases by at most 1.
* On `rem`, the sequence of remaining elements remain the same.
* No maximum limit for the size of a list. 

### List implementation

There are two main ways to implement a list: `Array` and `Linked List`.

#### Array

Time complexity of operations.

* **ins**. `O(n)`. Consider worst case, insert an el to position `0`, then need move all `N` els backwards.
* **rem**. `O(n)`. Same reason as `ins`.
* **get**. `O(1)`. Get an el directly by index (position), we also say constant time.
* **find**. `O(n)`. Content searching. 
* **empty**. `O(1)`. 
* **size**. `O(1)`.

#### Linked List

Time complexity of operations.

* **insCell**. `O(1)`. Move 2 link pointers.
* **remCell**. `O(1)`. 
* **ins(e, i)**. `O(n) get` + `O(1) insCell` => `O(n)`
* **rem**. `O(n) get` + `O(1) remCell` => `O(n)`.
* **get**. `O(n)`. No index like array.
* **find**. `O(n)`. content searching.
* **empty**. `O(1)`.
* **size**. `O(n)`. Or `O(1)` if keep a counter. (tradeoff between time and space).

### Build on List

`Stack` and `Queue` are `Lists` with special access disciplines. *No find (search)* by content and *No get (go into center of the list)*, which gives efficient implementation benefits.

#### Stack 

LAST IN FIRST OUT (LIFO), access top only. 

* **top(get)**. `O(1)`. Only top item available. 
* **push(ins)**. `O(1)`. 

#### Queue

FIST IN FIRST OUT (FIFO), access bottom only.

For linked impl. 
* **enq**. `O(1)`. 
* **deq**. `O(1)`. 

For array impl. 
* **enq**. `O(1)`. Add an el at the end of the array.
* **deq**. `O(n)`. Delete the first el of the array thus need move `N-1` els from position 1 to `N-1` forward.
